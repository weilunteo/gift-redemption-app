# Gift Redemption Portal 🎁

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Frameworks and Testing
This project uses the following frameworks and tools:

<b>Next.js</b>: The main framework for building the application 💻

<b>Typescript</b>: For type-checking and enhanced developer experience 😁

<b>Tailwind CSS</b>: For utility-first styling ✨

<b>Jest</b>: For unit testing of 4 test cases 🧪

## Assumptions
The portal serves solely for viewing whether the team has redeemed their gift. Updating the status will be initiated by clicking on the search bar again.


## Deployment 
The application has been hosted on Vercel, accessible [here](govtech-assessment-rxs6.vercel.app). However, due to existing bugs, it's recommended to view and debug the application locally on localhost instead.
